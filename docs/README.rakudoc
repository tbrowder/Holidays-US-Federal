B<Holidays::US::Federal> - Provides names, dates, and dates observed for US Federal holidays

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Holidays::US::Federal;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Holidays::US::Federal> is a module that provides information on the
eleven official U.S. federal holidays as of 2023-03-08 according to
data available online at
L<https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/>.
A description of the rules for traditional dates and when holidays are
actually observed as paid holidays off for federal employees is also
found on the site. All the data reflect current laws in Title 5 US
Code Section 6103.

This module provides a routine which provides a hash of the holidays
for a given year keyed by each holiday's traditional date.  Each
key is a Raku C<Date>, and the key's value is a C<class FedHoliday is Date::Event>
object.  The data are perpetual for any given year as long as Title 5
US Code Section 6103 stays unchanged.

For this collection there should be no overlapping holidays.  Each
instance is one with two different date attributes: (1) the
traditional C<date> and (2) the C<date-observed> which is the paid
day-off for most federal government employees (as well as for many
other employees in the US labor force).  If the dates are identical,
then that date is the only one to use on a calendar.  If they are
different, then both should be used.

Note the holidays also have a C<short-name> attribute which is not
official but has the value used by the author for his calendars in
order to fit nicely in a day cell on Letter paper using the author's
C<Calendar> module. With that style, day cells should be a bit wider
(but shorter) when using A4 paper, so the official name may fit
satisfactorily in that case.  Please file an issue if you have a
suggested 'short-name' for those currently without a value.

=begin item
NOTE: During the devlopment of this module, functions for finding
dates relative to other dates were found to be necessary and were
coded and published as a new Raku module: B<Date:Utils>. Those
routines are expected to be useful for various calendar creation
projects. They are:

=item C<nth-day-of-week-in-month>
=item C<nth-day-of-week-after-date>

For convenience, the routines have alternative names requiring fewer
key strokes. They are:

=item C<nth-dow-in-month>
=item C<nth-dow-after-date>
